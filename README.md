# My-first-To-Do-App
# 📝 My First To-Do App

A simple and responsive **To-Do List web app** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
You can **add, mark as completed, and delete tasks**, and your list will be **saved automatically in Local Storage** — so your data stays even after refreshing the page.  

The app is containerized with **Docker** using a lightweight **Nginx** server for easy deployment.
